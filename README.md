## Candy Survey (2017) - Data Cleaning with Pandas

The purpose of this project was to clean and wrangle data from a survey of Halloween candy to prepare it for a machine learning project. This has been modified from a data cleaning assignment completed for my Master's program. The end goal for this project is to clean the data so that it could be used to create a machine learning model in the future. We want to see if we are able to predict a person's gender based purely on their candy preferences. Note: a model was not created in this project. The data was simply cleaned and prepared for use.

The data set used is the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy data set as discussed in this boingboing article (https://boingboing.net/2017/10/30/the-2017-halloween-candy-hiera.html). This dataset provided an opportunity to work with very messy data, as respondents were allowed to enter unconstrained text for a number of the fields.
